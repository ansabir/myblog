## Introduction

Hello World,
My name is Sabir Ansari and I am working as a Service Engineer at One Click Service. Most of mine work is to provide technical support to customers. It includes troubleshoot hardware issues, network issues software issues but I want to become a developer. 

Because of work or you can say because of my laziness I am not able to learn enough to get job in that field.

So from today I will learn something new everyday and I will document myself here. I know it sound like simple but trust me, these simple thing will make a better writer, developer.

Let see how far I can go.

## Goal
I have to learn below technologies, to get the decent job.
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript
4. React
5. Python
6. MySql

I will start with MySql, to learn these things I will use free materials only like some blog, video or free course.

Why I started from last because, I am little bit comfortable in all these technologies but I am not that good to get the job in this field and it is my childhood habit to learn from back.

Wish me luck!!!!
